# Quaternary Calulator 
# Team 1 

This is a simple calculator program that performs operations on quaternary numbers, which are base- 4. This application features an intuitive user interface that allows users to perform operations:
- Addition 
- Subtraction 
- Multiplication 
- Division 

Along single- number operations using quaternary numbers: 
- Square 
- Square- root 

## Dependencies 
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 22.0.1; which can be dowloaded from Oracle: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk22-archive-downloads.html 
- JavaFX SDK version 22.0.1; which can be downloaded from Gluon: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ 
- JUnit; which can be added using Gradle and should be included in project’s dependencies. 

## Installation 
To run this project: 
1. Clone the repository local machine on your IDE: https://github.com/SLMarv/QuaternaryCalculator.git 
2. Edit run configurations 
- In the gradle project section, make sure to select the project folder inside of QuaternaryCalculator. 
- Put in Project for the name section 
- Type run in the section label Run In the gradle project section, make sure to select the project folder inside of QuaternaryCalculator
- Hit apply 

This will ensure the project builds and is prepared to run correctly. 

3. Run the application 
- Run the application by selecting the ‘run’ option from you IDE

## How to Use the Calculator  
Once the application is running, you can use the application to perform calculations in the quaternary numeral system. You are able to select from 4 numbers (​​0, 1, 2, 3) and select the operation you want to run and application will display the result of the operation.

## Troubleshooting 
In case of any issues encountered
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and configured in your run configurations 
- Verify correct JDK and JavaFX versions
