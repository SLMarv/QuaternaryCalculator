# QuaternaryCalculator
# Functional Requirements
## High Priority
- System will:
  - Have only 4 buttons for numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3
  - Do operations with 2 numbers
  - User will enter a quaternary number
  - Then press an operation button
  - Then enter another number
  - Then press the ‘=’ button -> will display the result of the operation
- Operations should be:
  - Add
  - Subtract
  - Divide
  - Multiply
- Have a visible display for:

- Should only work on integer values
- The visible display from which you can view entered numbers & the result of operations will use a toggle button which will allow viewing the number in both:
  - Quaternary
  - Decimal

## Low Priority
- Do operations with 1 number
  - User will enter a quaternary number
  - Then press an operation button
  - -> will display the result of the operation
- Operations will be:
  - Square
  - Square-root

# Non-Functional Requirements
- Implemented in IntelliJ IDEA & JDK >= 12
- Logic should be separate for:
  - UI
  - Program logic
- Program logic should be unit tested
- System will have a `.gitignore` file to ignore temporary files
  - Can be created automatically on: [link]
- 1 team member will create a repo & add others as collaborators
- Repo will have `README.md` file for explanations of the project
  - Will have screenshots of the project
